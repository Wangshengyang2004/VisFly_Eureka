# VisFly-Eureka (quadro-llm) - Code Quality Improvement TODO

> **📋 For completed tasks and resolved issues, see [COMPLETED.md](./COMPLETED.md) and [BUGS.md](./BUGS.md)**

## 🚨 CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix - Blocking)

*No active critical issues* ✅

**Recent Assessment**: Previous security concerns were found to be overstated upon code review.

## ⚠️ WARNING ISSUES (Should Fix)

### 3. Logging System Inconsistencies 📝
- [x] `/quadro_llm/training/visfly_training_wrapper.py` - Replace 35+ print statements
- [x] Replace remaining print in `/quadro_llm/training/parallel_training.py` (file removed)
- [ ] Remove print statements in `algorithms/BPTT.py:285,290,336,371`
- [ ] Remove print statements in `tests/` files (test_tensorboard_integration.py, test_baseline.py)
- [ ] Standardize log levels across all modules
- [ ] Remove emoji decorations from production logs unless specifically requested

### 4. Error Handling Improvements 🚫
**Priority**: WARNING  
**Status**: ACTIVE

**Minor Issues Found**:
- [ ] Some generic `except Exception:` handlers could be more specific
- [ ] Add more descriptive error messages in some modules
- [ ] Improve error context in GPU monitor operations

**Solution**: Gradually improve error specificity where beneficial

### 5. Type Safety Enhancements 📊
**Priority**: WARNING  
**Status**: ACTIVE

**Missing Type Hints** (Quality of Life):
- [ ] `quadro_llm/eureka_visfly.py` - Some public methods without type hints
- [ ] `quadro_llm/pipeline.py` - Some core pipeline methods untyped
- [ ] `run.py` - Main training functions could use return types
- [ ] Configuration loading functions could be better typed

## 💡 SUGGESTIONS (Nice to Have)

### 6. Minor Security Improvements 🔐
- [ ] Clean up example API key in `configs/api_keys.yaml:16` (ifopen provider)
- [ ] Add basic API key format validation
- [ ] Consider masking keys in debug logs (if any exist)

### 7. Enhanced Configuration Validation 🔍
- [ ] Add minimal `validate_critical_config()` in `main.py`
- [ ] Add algorithm compatibility checks
- [ ] Verify CUDA availability when GPU requested
- [ ] Validate config file schema before loading

### 8. Performance Optimizations ⚡
- [ ] Cache evaluation worker script path to avoid repeated file system access
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for parallel LLM evaluations
- [ ] Add memory usage monitoring and automatic cleanup
- [ ] Optimize tensor operations in reward function injection
- [ ] Add batch processing for multiple reward evaluations

### 9. Documentation Improvements 📚
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all public APIs
- [ ] Document expected exceptions and error codes
- [ ] Create system architecture diagram
- [ ] Add inline code examples for complex functions
- [ ] Document configuration file schema and options

### 10. Test Coverage Expansion 🧪
- [ ] Add integration tests for full pipeline
- [ ] Test error propagation across modules
- [ ] Add performance regression tests

## 📋 Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: ✅ COMPLETED - Critical Quality Fixes
1. **✅ Break Down God Functions** - Split large functions into focused components
2. **✅ Extract Magic Numbers** - Centralized configuration constants
3. **✅ Standardize Error Handling** - Custom exception hierarchy and consistent patterns

### Phase 2: Structural Improvements (Next 2 Weeks)
4. **Eliminate Code Duplication** - Extract common patterns to utilities
   - [ ] Create shared environment registry utility
   - [ ] Extract common configuration loading patterns
   - [ ] Consolidate algorithm creation logic
5. **Split Complex Classes** - Single responsibility principle
   - [ ] Break down `SubprocessRewardEvaluator` (400+ lines, multiple responsibilities)
   - [ ] Split `DynamicGPUResourceManager` into focused components
   - [ ] Separate memory profiling from queue management
6. **Environment Registry Pattern** - Replace if-elif chains
   - [ ] Implement factory pattern for environment creation
   - [ ] Create extensible environment registration system
   - [ ] Remove hard-coded environment mappings

### Phase 3: Quality Enhancements (Next Sprint)
7. **Type Safety Improvements** - Add comprehensive type hints
   - [ ] Add type hints to all public methods in core modules
   - [ ] Improve configuration type safety
   - [ ] Add return type annotations throughout
8. **Performance Optimizations** - Memory and caching improvements
   - [ ] Optimize GPU memory checking (avoid subprocess calls in loops)
   - [ ] Implement better caching strategies
   - [ ] Batch expensive operations
9. **Import Restructuring** - Clean up circular dependencies
   - [ ] Restructure imports to avoid circular dependencies
   - [ ] Standardize import patterns
   - [ ] Remove dynamic import complexity

### Phase 4: Advanced Improvements (Future)
10. **Documentation** - Complete API documentation
11. **Test Coverage** - Comprehensive test suite
12. **Architecture Refactoring** - Long-term structural improvements

### Phase 5: Complete Logging Migration (Ongoing)
13. **Remove Remaining Print Statements**
    - [ ] `algorithms/BPTT.py:285,290,336,371` - Replace with logging
    - [ ] `tests/` files - Convert test output to proper logging
    - [ ] Clean up example API key in `configs/api_keys.yaml:16`

## ✅ Recently Completed
> **See [COMPLETED.md](./COMPLETED.md) for detailed accomplishments and [BUGS.md](./BUGS.md) for resolved issues**

## 🏁 System Status: STABLE ✅
Core pipeline working correctly. All critical issues resolved.  
**Next Steps**: Focus on code quality improvements and remaining print statement cleanup.

## 📝 Notes
- Always test changes with 2x5 configuration before committing
- Ensure no API keys are exposed in commits or logs
- Keep backward compatibility when possible
- Document breaking changes clearly
- Focus on incremental quality improvements rather than major overhauls
