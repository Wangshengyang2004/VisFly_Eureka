  description: >
    Perform a flip maneuver: HOVER -> FLIP -> HOVER trajectory.

    The drone must:
    1. Hover at target position initially (hover_before_steps)
    2. Execute a complete flip maneuver (flip_steps)
    3. Return to stable hover at target position (hover_after_steps)
    4. Maintain control throughout the entire trajectory
    5. Minimize deviation from target position during and after flip

    Reward function should:
    - Reward maintaining position during hover phases
    - Reward completing the flip maneuver smoothly
    - Penalize deviations from target position
    - Balance stability vs. maneuver execution
    - Provide trajectory-phase-aware shaping rewards
